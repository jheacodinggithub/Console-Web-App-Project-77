            <P>Console application (app) is a program developed in Visual Studio which accepts input parameter, calls the required service, runs business logic and sends output to the console.The console is an operating system window where users interact with the operating system or with a text-based console application by entering text input through the computer keyboard, and by reading text output from the computer terminal.
                You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript.The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
